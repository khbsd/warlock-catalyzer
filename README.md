The Catalyzer 

Pact of Conduction
- focused on ranged, gets a weaker lightning bolt at lv1 as a cantrip along with acid blast
- gets bonus to ranged damage based on charges
remaining as an invocation at lv3
access to stronger chain lightning spell

Pact of Electrolysis
- focus on melee, gets custom shocking grasp at lv1 along with acid blast
- gets access to bonus melee damage based on remaining charges as an invocation at lv3 
shocking grasp scales better
- gain 3 extra hit points per class level.

both pacts may choose bits from the other pact as they level up

catalysts that may be chosen at levels 3, 6, 9, 12:

- shocking grasp as a melee attack
- weaker lightning bolt as a cantrip
- other pact damage bonus (ranged/melee) based on remaining batter charges
- a bonus 1d4 of Lightning damage to your acidic blast. (can stack with agonizing blast)
- you gain proficiency in medicine, and you maximize all hit points you regain when you heal.
- at level 12, you may take the electrolysis passive, so it no longer requires a battery charge.

a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can use shocking grasp on yourself, taking half damage after level 6 and no damage at level 12 (via resistance/immunity granted at those levels to lightning damage). this restores a number of battery charges equal to your proficiency bonus/2. if wearing robo parts, you take half damage at level 1 and no damage at level 6.

at level three you may use your body as a rudimentary voltaic pile. you gain battery charges equal to half your class level that you may use to cast specific spells or regain a warlock spell slot. each spell costs a battery charge. 

you do not bleed when struck: instead, the ground around you becomes coated in acid.

you add your intelligence modifier to your armor class.

spells
- Electrolysis: You expend a battery charge to aid in neutralizing your targets. for the next three turns, your attacks do 1d4 bonus lightning damage. if the target has the Acid condition or is standing in acid, they take an additional 1d4 of Acid damage. if you have a robotic limb, both damage bonuses increase to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus.

- Brine: you expend a battery charge to overproduce some of the briney solution that you replaced your blood with, and augment your next acidic blast cast with it. wherever it hits, a 2m circle becomes coated with acid. any enemies hit by this attack gain the Acid condition for 3 turns.

- Lower pH: You expend a battery charge to regain hit points equal to 1d4 plus your intelligence modifer and your proficiency bonus. if you have a robot arm, you may add your intelligence modifier twice.
